C programming is like a recipe book for telling a computer what to do.
Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful language that allows you to write instructions (called code) for the computer to follow.
These instructions can solve problems, create software, and control hardware.

C was created in 1972 by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs in the United States.
It was designed to improve upon earlier programming languages and to help build the Unix operating system.
Because of its speed, efficiency, and simplicity, C is called the "mother of programming languages".
Many modern languages, like C++, Java, and Python, are based on C.
It's widely used for building system software, operating systems, games, and applications that need to run very fast and efficiently.
