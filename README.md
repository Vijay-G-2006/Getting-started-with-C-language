# Getting-started-with-C-language
Hi , My name is Vijay.
I am a student pursuing CSE(Cybersecurity) at Rajalakshmi Engineering College,Chennai.
In my 1st Semester of college, I got introduced to this new programming language called C.
It took me time to learn this new programming language.
I don't want you to go through the same.

So here I am , sharing my learning progress with you and make your path easier with appropriate resources and codes.
